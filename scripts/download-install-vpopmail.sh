# Vpopmail is a set of programs for creating and managing multiple virtual domains on a qmail server, 
#   with full support for many POP/IMAP servers. 
# A web interface to vpopmail called QmailAdmin is on SourceForge as well.

# Prepare mysql for vpopmail: (todo)
# Notes: The following (mysql related) steps are useful (but not necessary) to do 
#         before actually configuring, compiling and installing vpopmail.
#        It is because there are certain "tests", which are performed as part of vpopmail installation
#         , which tries to make a connection with the configured mysql server with the credentials you provide.
#        This information is shown at the end of the make install-strip command, which you can't miss. 
#        I just want to find an automated way to get all of the following done,
#          ,  **without** hardcoding dbhost, dbname, dbuser and db password.
#        I also want to be able to setup a mysql database through the script - in an automated way.


# mkdir ~vpopmail/etc
# chown vpopmail:vchkpw ~vpopmail/etc
# echo "localhost|0|vpopmaildbuser|redhat|vpopmail" > ~vpopmail/etc/vpopmail.mysql


# mysql -u root
# mysql> create database vpopmail;
# mysql> grant all on vpopmail.* to vpopmaildbuser@localhost identified by 'redhat';
# mysql> flush privileges;

# Notes:
# * DO NOT USE the --enable-maildrop switch in vpopmail,
#     , otherwise you will not get any mails and will get "Unable to open mailbox" errors in the maillog.
# * Need to work on "onchange-script" later. Don't use it at the moment.
