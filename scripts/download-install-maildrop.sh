# Questions: What is maildrop? 
#            Why a piece of software in qmail installation is pulled from courier MTA website?
# Answer:
# The maildrop package contains the maildrop delivery agent/mail filter. 
#   This mail filter module is included in the Courier mail server, which uses it to filter incoming mail. 
#   So, you don't need to install it separately if you are using courier MTA.
#   But, we are not using Courier MTA! We are using Qmail.
#   Maildrop can also be used with other mail servers as well. So we will use it in our qmail installation.
# We download it from courier MTA website because they are ones developing it. 
#   ,(and) As mentioned above it is a standalone package which can be used with other MTAs too (like qmail).

# Big Question: Why install maildrop?
# Answer:
# I covered the answer in detail in my howtos on wbitt.com and blog.wbitt.com.
# First, the links, then the explanation:

#
# Basically we need reformime from maildrop, which is used by qmail-scanner.
#   QmailScanner will stop working if it fails to find reformime. 
#   Actually, qmail-inject will also start failing. So you need it.
#   There is no package which provides reformime so maildrop is needed. 
# Qmail-ScannerÍ„'s website lists this as a requirement, and also addresses this in two FAQs
# The FAQ # 9 and 10 on Qmail-Scanner site also explain the requirement of maildrop:
#   It says I must have reformime from the maildrop package! But I like procmail/[insert favorite MDA here]. 
#     Why do I have to....? 
#     You don't. reformime is needed for the extracting of MIME attachments by Qmail-Scanner - 
#       it doesn't have to be used by any other part of your system. Keep using procmail/whatever :-)
#   It says I must have maildrop installed. Will I have to install .qmail files for all users...?. 
#     You don't. Maildrop isn't used at all - only the reformime program that comes with it is. 
#     Qmail-Scanner installs at a very low level and doesn't require any per-user configuration.
#
# Memo: Some of this information is in the document: "Qmail on Centos 6.6 64 bit"
