# This script downloads and installs ezmlm-idx without installing the original ezmlm 0.5.3 by djb.
# It is because ezmlm-idx is now a standalone package.
# On one of my production servers, ezmlm-7.1.1 did not pick up the existing mailing lists,
#   so I had to use ezmlm-6.0.1 . Also, using mysql for this task is pretty useless, as all the 
#   mailing lists are maintained as files under the ~vpopmail/<domainname>/  directory. 
#   And, qmailadmin sees those mailing lists just fine.

# If you want, you can compile ezmlm with mysql support. For that, you need to adjust certain files:
# * conf-cc
# * conf-ld
# * conf-mysql
# 
# See: http://ezmlm.untroubled.org/archive/7.2.2/README.mysql for more details
# Prerequisite: mysql-devel
